<p><em>or</em></p>
<h1 id="unwinding">Unwinding</h1>
<p>Due to a worker strike, the university semester ended late this year.
That meant everything had to be compressed into little more than a month
in order to wrap up what would have taken four. Now that we’re almost
through it, my mind wanders to writing. It is almost always what springs
from the void in me, what has been winded up loosens and the scattered
meaning starts to recollect into the drain of language and swirl through
the piping of my nervous system.</p>
<p><em>Wind</em> is air that has been somehow compressed. If there was
no pressure pushing it anywhere, it would be just expansive air,
floating in peace with the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If you’d entertain this thought further, consider a work of visual
art. It can be more figurative, clearly depicting shapes that mean
something, and therefore able to convey an array of ideas to whatever
extent of detail the artist wants. Conversely, it can be more abstract,
where ideas will be a lot more sparse, possibly to the point where
nothing at all is conveyed other than the appearance, whatever aesthetic
is employed being the whole message in itself. Very little is packed
into the work, just like the air you can’t even feel weighing on
you.</p>
<p>In computing, and more specifically in the realm of programming – a
craft presently overshadowed by the semantically starved jargon of
whatever the department responsible for inflating public perception
numbers is called these days – simplicity is often emphasized. Code is
supposed to be clear, expressive and clean. A software application is
supposed to have as few dependencies as possible, and strive to keep it
simple, or risk stupidity.</p>
<p>While that is a lofty goal, and while clear, expressive and clean
code is a refreshing and tranquilizing sight, more often than not
software just can’t be simple.</p>
<p>Not having dependencies means implementing more and more yourself.
There are corner cases to cover, tests to run, different architectures
and operating systems to support. Even the simplest of software ideas,
say, a calculator, a program that prints back a sentence in reverse,
that displays a picture you give it, whatever you conceive as the
simplest use case, is hardly ever implemented with simplicity in the
naïve sense of something that is, quite literally, simplistic.</p>
<p>More often than not, simplicity is actually abstraction. The breaking
apart of complexity behind a simpler facade. More so a way to manage
complexity by conveying it simply than to enact simplicity in its actual
sense. Each step in abstraction is actually a layer deeper into
intricacy. And yet, it makes things immensely easier to manage and
understand.</p>
<p>For some reason, I have always felt very drawn to abstract works.
Staring into them, there is no expectation to understand, get, or argue
about. Interestingly, to me that also means they couldn’t be any more
clear. It does not mean a specific, intelligible message is conveyed
from the artist to me, rather, it means whatever impression is caused on
the viewer was never intended to reach too deep anyways. It never
intended to carry that much through its medium.</p>
<p>Sometimes, too much detail, no matter how specific, can draw an idea
so far out that it becomes harder and harder to grasp. In contrast to
that, a brisk exposition can get the message across like lightning.</p>
<p>So detail does not always convey meaning, although it can convey a
specific meaning to someone who will bear with you as you build the
context for it. Otherwise, you could convey your message just as
effectively in an abstract manner if your receiver already has that
context from the outset.</p>
<p>In computing, such possibility is simply absent from us. No context
whatsoever can be assumed, and if it is present, that is because some
other structure is providing it.</p>
<p>Complexity produces confusion, confusion produces frustration, and
frustration can lead to either surrender or a rebound. So the
interesting thing about this pressurizing of ideas is that it springs
back into action a process that may reverse it or deflect into something
else entirely.</p>
<p>Instead of surrendering to the frustration of complexity, sometimes I
actually take the time to recollect myself and analyze it into
understanding. This feeling of winning over something that had me on my
knees and ready to give up is a very gratifying one. It convinces me I
can squeeze grit from despair if I bet on it and willingly risk
desperation in order to see it through.</p>
<p>Yet, after chasing the deadline of effort all of it relaxes back into
this state. In it, the only way to rest is to embrace complexity as the
whole, and simplicity as one of its manifestations. It is so cold right
now in the south, but in the north it is not. Four days and nine hours
ago it was the peak of the winter. I’m wrapped in blankets and the room
is dark like the depths of a submarine cave, LED lights here and there
like fluorescent eyes blinking in silence.</p>
<p>The professor had us build games and then present them to the whole
faculty. Among the outputs, one algorithm I produced stuck with me for
what I deem is simplicity. It is responsible for causing an enemy to
chase the player by finding the difference between their positions and
lowering it:</p>

<p>It could be further abstracted. The logic is repetitive. The math
could be condensed. But should it? Would that make it harder or easier
to understand? And to whom? There is no single answer, and yet I would
really appreciate knowing.</p>
