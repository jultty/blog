For those subscribing to this blog's RSS feeds:

First, if you are getting links but would rather only be notified about posts, you are probably subscribed to an "all content" feed. You can find all feed options in the [feeds](/feeds) page.

Second, as per a [recent thread](https://mastodon.bsd.cafe/@jutty/113013450769036273) I started on Mastodon, I am planning on keeping only the Atom feeds in the future.

Currently, all feeds are served in two formats, for example:

- <https://blog.jutty.dev/posts/rss.xml>
- <https://blog.jutty.dev/posts/atom.xml>

On a much later date, I plan on retiring the `rss.xml` feeds, so if that's what you are subscribed to, consider changing to the equivalent `atom.xml` feed sometime in the future.

Both formats will keep working for now. The only immediate change will be that only the `atom.xml` ones will be advertised on the [feeds](/feeds) page and on HTML meta tags.
